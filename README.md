# eXplore _ built with React

This project was built with Alchemy's NFT API to query data on non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain.
The data that were being retrieved included:
1. Name of the NFT address 
2. Description of the NFT address
3. Floor price of the NFT address
4. Total supply of the NFT address
5. imageURL of the NFT address (Take note:  Image of gradient background will appear if the API fails to retrive this data.)
6. imageURL of each NFT tokenId 
7. Discord channel of the NFT
8. Token Id of the NFT
9. Attributes of each NFT tokenId (Take note: In this project, the frontend will only display the first two attributes.)

### **Disclaimer**
1. Since not all metadata fields will be filled out by the NFT creator, hence, data such as description and discrod channel may not be displayed for certain addresses. 
2. Alchemy's NFT API returns a maximum of 100 results per response. Hence, only 100 NFTs will be shown on the frontend.

This project is still in development mode and future improvement is needed. It might take some time to load the webpages.
Thank you.
